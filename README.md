# What does this project do

A car market for people to list their vehicles and set them for sale.
Driving the next era of ether based crypto-commerce. ;)

Owners of a vehicle can set the price in ETHER when they list a vehicle up for sale.

Metamask integration will allow you to see which vehicles are owned by you / can be purchased if owned by another address.

Metamask should be connected to the local ganache-cli environment on port 8545. 

Select the address you want to use from metamask when interacting with the car mart. 

1. List your car for sale and set the price asking for
2. Car owner can also transfer the ownership of their listed vehicle to another address.
3. Someone can buy the listed cars that is not their's by sending in ETH that covers the price asked.
4. Purchase car by sending the price in Ether and any extra will be refunded back to buyer. 

5. Car Mart contract owner will take a small fee out of the purchase price when a car gets sold. (1% currently).
6. Circuit breaker will stop people from selling and buying cars / allow owner to withdraw the balance from contract.
